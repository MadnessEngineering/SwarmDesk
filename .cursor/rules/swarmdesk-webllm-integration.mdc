# SwarmDesk WebLLM Integration Overview

## Project Structure
SwarmDesk is a 3D cyberpunk agent command center built with Three.js. Main files:
- [swarmdesk.js](mdc:swarmdesk.js) - Core 3D environment and agent system
- [floating-panel-system.js](mdc:floating-panel-system.js) - Floating UI panels
- [swarmdesk-dashboard-hooks.js](mdc:swarmdesk-dashboard-hooks.js) - Dashboard integration

## WebLLM Integration Goals
- Replace current mock agent responses with local AI inference
- Enable users to download and run models locally in browser
- Provide per-agent model configuration
- Maintain cyberpunk aesthetic and user experience

## Key Agent Types
- Git Assistant - Repository management
- Browser Agent - Web automation
- Haiku Bot - Creative content generation
- Project Manager - Task coordination
- Greeter - User interface routing

## Architecture Integration Points
- Agent dialogue system in [swarmdesk.js](mdc:swarmdesk.js) `generateAgentResponse()`
- Settings panel in [../src/components/Settings.jsx](mdc:../src/components/Settings.jsx)
- Floating panels for model management UI
- Browser storage for model caching

## WebLLM Requirements
- WebGPU-compatible browser (Chrome 113+, Firefox 121+)
- Model weights in MLC format hosted on HuggingFace
- Web workers for UI performance
- Progressive model loading and caching
