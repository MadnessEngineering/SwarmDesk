# Task 3: Model Management System

## Primary Objective
Implement comprehensive model download, caching, and management system for WebLLM models.

## Key Focus Areas
- Build model download manager with progress tracking
- Implement efficient browser storage optimization (IndexedDB)
- Create model switching functionality without page reload
- Add SwarmDesk floating panel for model status monitoring
- Implement robust error handling and fallback systems

## Core Files to Study
- [floating-panel-system.js](mdc:floating-panel-system.js) - Floating panel creation patterns
- [floating-panel-advanced.js](mdc:floating-panel-advanced.js) - Advanced panel features
- [swarmdesk.js](mdc:swarmdesk.js) - Integration with existing systems

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create ModelManager class for download/cache operations
2. Implement IndexedDB storage for model persistence
3. Add model switching without requiring page reload
4. Create "Model Status" floating panel for SwarmDesk
5. Add comprehensive error handling and model validation

## Technical Requirements
- IndexedDB for efficient model storage
- Service Worker for background downloads (optional)
- Progress tracking for large model downloads
- Model verification and integrity checking
- Graceful fallback when models fail to load

## Expected Deliverables
- ModelManager class with download/cache functionality
- SwarmDesk floating panel for model management
- Model switching interface
- Error handling and fallback systems
