<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user is asking about several things:

1. Display README files of projects at each desk in the SwarmDesk interface
2. Make the workshop more interactive
3. Add MCP toolkit for debugging on the wall
4. Work on branches for safety
5. Use the available tooling

Let me break this down:

1. First, I should understand the current state by reading the SwarmDesk JavaScript file to see how the desks are currently implemented
2. Look at the README to understand the project better
3. Create a git branch for safety
4. Then work on implementing the features

Let me start by reading the key files and understanding the current state, then create a branch and start implementing the improvements.</details></think>

I love the madness! Let's make this SwarmDesk workshop truly interactive! ðŸš€ Let me first examine the current state and then create a branch to work safely on these exciting enhancements.
